# leaflet-challenge


## Citations and Sources
- This challenge was completed as a collaborative effort between Martin Bedino, David Pinsky, Lois Stetson, and Nathan-Andrew Tompkins (myself). Because of this the HTML and JS code will look nearly identical to that submitted by those specific members of the UCF Data Bootcamp, except for changes I made after the collaboration ended to further produce a better front-end experience.

## Changes and Refinements
- JavaScript: Pulled more information from the geojson source to populate a more robust popup for each earthquake, adding the location.
- JavaScript: Added a header to the legend so that the key viewer can better understand what the color-depth information is conveying.
- HTML: Removed commented code that went unused in the final product.
